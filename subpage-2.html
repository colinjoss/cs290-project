                <h2>Project 2: AutoDiary</h2>
                <h4>A program that automates upkeep of my personal diary</h4>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    For the past 8 years, I've kept a detailed diary. This diary is not
                    written, as one might expect, but instead consists of a collection of 
                    audio recordings.
                    These recordings are accompanied by a spreadsheet that makes it easier
                    to find information and keeps track of various other stats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to simplify the maintainence of 
                    this diary, such as calculating statistics and adding new entries 
                    to the collection.
                </p>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>
                    When I started coding, I pursued a loose vision
                    of what I wanted to accomplish. I started by figuring out how to pull
                    data from my speadsheets. In early drafts, this was done with Python's
                    built-in csv library, but in later versions I learned how to use Pandas - 
                    a library I discovered to be massively useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, I focused on creating an interface through which
                    data could be accessed or modified - the final product needed
                    to be easy to use if it was going to rival my deeply-rooted 
                    habits of doing things. I accomplished this with a Python package named
                    inquirer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I tackled the biggest challenge of the project: implementing
                    different tools for modifying and exporting my diary data. Doing so 
                    required me to learn to use many new Python modules. Mutagen allowed
                    me to pull metadata from mp3 files and record the length of my diary 
                    entries. Pandas was used in almost every facet
                    of the final prodcut, because of its power to navigate large amounts
                    of data. Python's Regex library was instrumentable in creating a 
                    search function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below is one of the most complicated functions I wrote:
                </p>
                <div id='scroll'>
                    def update_statistics_csv(self, last_entry):
                </br>
                    &nbsp if last_entry is None:
                </br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp return None
                </br>
                    &nbsp # Generates list of all complete years (except 2013, a partial)
                </br>
                    &nbsp current_year = int(self.get_current_year())
                </br>
                    &nbsp total_years = []
                </br>
                    &nbsp while current_year != 2013:
                </br>
                    &nbsp current_year = current_year - 1
                </br>
                    &nbsp total_years.append(current_year)
                </br>
                </br>
                    &nbsp # Calculate key statistics for every available year
                </br>
                    &nbsp for year in total_years:
                </br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp current_year = self._diary.loc[self._diary['year'] == year]
                </br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp year_happiness = current_year.describe()['happiness']['mean']
                </br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp # Calculate lists of months and weekdays ranked by happiness, people ranked by mentions
                </br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp months_ranked = self.calculate_happiest_month(current_year)
                </br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp weekdays_ranked = self.calculate_happiest_weekday(current_year)
                </br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp people_ranked = self.calculate_most_mentioned(current_year)
                </br>
                </br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp # Updates the stats spreadsheet
                </br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp v = 'w' if year == int(self.get_current_year()) - 1 else 'a'
                </br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp with open('statistics.csv', f'{v}', newline='') as outfile:
                </br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp pd.DataFrame({'': year_happiness}, index=[year]).to_csv(outfile)
                </br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp pd.DataFrame(months_ranked, index=[year]).to_csv(outfile)
                </br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp pd.DataFrame(weekdays_ranked, index=[year]).to_csv(outfile)
                </br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp pd.DataFrame(people_ranked, index=[year])[0:10].to_csv(outfile)
                </div>
                <p>
                    This function creates a spreadsheet full of statistical data for every recorded
                    year in my diary. It uses information such as a happiness index I've used to
                    rate days with since 2013 in order to calculate averages based on year,
                    month, and weekday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was a lot to do, and sometimes I felt bogged down in the amount
                    of things I had to keep track of. As you will see, this feeling is 
                    closely related to the biggest lesson I learned.

                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    The biggest lesson I learned from this project is that making a plan
                    is very important. I could have saved a lot of time had I started with
                    an outline and pseudocode, but as it is I had to do a lot of backtracking
                    and reorganizing to figure out how it would all come together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another big lesson I learned was how much the way data is stored makes
                    a difference in how quickly it can be accessed. In earlier versions of 
                    this project, I stored data from my spreadsheets in a series of nested
                    dictionaries. Accessing data in these nested diaries required a set of 
                    nested loops, resulting in poor algorithm time complexity.
