                <h2>Project 1: Babel Bot</h2>
                <h4>A Twitter bot that makes humorous mistranslations</h4>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    I participated in the HackOR hackathon with a group of three others.
                    We needed to come up with a project. In the end, we
                    went with my idea: a Twitter bot that would reply to Tweets with the
                    same text after being translated through several random languages. Like a game
                    of telephone, the goal is for the original message to be distorted 
                    into a (usually humorous) mistranslation.
                </p>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>
                    Creating Babel Bot took place over 48 hours. In that time, each member
                    of the team contributed by writing code and learning how to use Tweepy,
                    Python's Twitter library, and other required modules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team proceeded to work on Babel Bot in an unscripted, collaborative 
                    way, since time was short to plan out details. Members would alert others what part they were working on over 
                    Discord, so no two members were working on the same thing. If any team
                    member encountered a problem, there was always someone to help them
                    out it. It was a very positive experience working with others for the
                    first time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest contributions I made to this project was learning how 
                    to set up a Listener with Tweepy. What I learned became a very large 
                    part of the final code, eventually containing functions other members 
                    had written.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was one exception to our "first come, first served" system:
                    each member wrote their own version of the translate function. Though 
                    inefficient, coding this way had its merits. For example, it was an
                    opportunity to really watch how another member coded and reflect on
                    what they did better or worse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm proud to say my translate function was selected as the bulk of
                    what ended up in our final code. This code can be seen below:
                </p>
                <div id='scroll'>
                    lang_dict = GoogleTranslator.get_supported_languages(as_dict=True)
                    </br>
                    lang_codes = list(lang_dict.values())
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    def translate(text):
                    </br>
                    &nbsp origin_lang = single_detection(text, api_key=secrets.DTL)
                    </br>
                    &nbsp languages = random.sample(lang_codes, 10)
                    </br>
                    &nbsp for lang in languages:
                    </br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp text = GoogleTranslator(source='auto', target=lang).translate(text)
                    </br>
                    &nbsp return GoogleTranslator(source='auto', target=origin_lang).translate(text)
                </div>
                <p>
                    My solution was chosen for its brevity.
                    A list of ten random languages is created, and the given text is translated
                    from one language to the next before being translated back to the origin
                    lanuage and returned.
                </p>

                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge overcome was the unfamiliar task of working with
                    other programmers. We all had to learn how to use Git collaboratively as
                    as we attempted to finish our project. None of us had experience with 
                    using Git in this way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the hackathon, there was only one notable mishap with Git.
                    Changes were merged in the remote, but some data was accidentally lost.
                    Working through this issue was a valuable opportunity to problem-solve 
                    a potential real-world problem - what do you do when code is misplaced or
                    accidentally removed? It's easier to mismanage code when multiple brains
                    are working on it.
